Improve Documentation: The README file provides basic information about the library, its installation, usage, and references. However, it lacks detailed documentation about the library's functionalities, parameters, and methods. This could be improved by adding more comprehensive documentation, including docstrings for all functions and classes, explaining the purpose and the expected inputs and outputs. You could also consider adding a more detailed guide or tutorial, perhaps in the form of additional Jupyter notebooks, to help new users understand how to use the library effectively. realpython.com

Modularize Code: Without access to the actual code, it's difficult to make specific suggestions. However, in general, a good practice to follow when refactoring is to ensure that the code is modular. This means that each function or class should have a single responsibility. If there are any large, complex functions or classes, consider breaking them down into smaller, more manageable pieces.

Error Handling and Logging: Again, without seeing the code, it's hard to know if this is already in place. However, robust error handling and logging are crucial for any library. Ensure that potential errors are caught and handled gracefully, with clear and helpful error messages. Additionally, consider adding logging to help users diagnose and troubleshoot issues.

Add Unit Tests: If not already present, adding unit tests would be a valuable addition to the library. Unit tests help ensure code reliability by testing individual units of source code (e.g., functions or methods) to verify that they behave as expected. This can also make future refactoring easier, as you can be confident that changes haven't inadvertently introduced bugs.

Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implementing a CI/CD pipeline can help to automate the testing and deployment of the library. This ensures that any changes to the code are automatically tested before they're merged, helping to maintain code quality.

Code Linting and Formatting: Lastly, ensure the code adheres to standard Python formatting guidelines (PEP 8). Tools like flake8 or black can help with this. Consistent formatting makes the code easier to read and understand
